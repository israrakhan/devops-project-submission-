AWS EC2 Website Deployment - Project Report
Project Overview
Project Title: Deploy a Multi-Page Business Website on AWS EC2 using Git, Linux & Nginx

Duration: 4-5 Days

Difficulty Level: Medium

Objective: Successfully build and deploy a complete static website using the GitHub → EC2 → Nginx workflow, gaining practical experience in real DevOps processes, Linux server administration, and cloud infrastructure management.

Project Summary: This project involved creating a multi-page business website (Coffee Blends - a responsive coffee shop and restaurant website) and deploying it on AWS EC2 using Nginx web server. The project demonstrates end-to-end DevOps workflow including version control with Git, EC2 instance management, Linux command line operations, and web server configuration.

Step-by-Step Process
Day 1: Website Creation & GitHub Setup
Task 1: Build Multi-Page Website
Created a responsive 5-page website with HTML and CSS (no templates)

Pages Developed:

Home page with hero section and call-to-action

About page with company story and team information

Services page showcasing coffee blends and restaurant offerings

Contact page with contact form and location details

Gallery/Portfolio page for visual showcase

Technologies Used: HTML5 + CSS3 + JavaScript

Design Approach: Responsive design for mobile and desktop compatibility

Task 2: GitHub Repository Setup
Created repository: business-website-project

Added all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files

Uploaded assets and images

Created comprehensive README with:

Project description highlighting Coffee Blends concept

Technology stack documentation

Local screenshots and setup instructions

Features overview including e-commerce capabilities

Day 2: EC2 Setup & Linux Configuration
Task 1: Launch EC2 Instance
Instance Details:

AMI: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

Instance Type: t2.micro (eligible for free tier)

Security Group Configuration:

SSH (Port 22) - for remote access

HTTP (Port 80) - for web traffic

Elastic IP Assignment: Attached static Elastic IP for consistent public access

Task 2: SSH Connection Establishment
Generated and configured EC2 key pair (.pem file)

Set proper file permissions: chmod 400 key.pem

Successfully established SSH connection: ssh -i key.pem ubuntu@<elastic-ip>

Verified secure remote access to instance

Task 3: Nginx Installation
Updated system packages: sudo apt update

Upgraded existing packages: sudo apt upgrade -y

Installed Nginx: sudo apt install nginx -y

Verified Nginx service status: sudo systemctl status nginx

Confirmed Nginx running and enabled on boot

Day 3: Git Integration & Nginx Configuration
Task 1: Git Installation
Installed Git on EC2: sudo apt install git -y

Configured Git if needed for future commits

Task 2: Repository Cloning
Cloned website repository: git clone https://github.com/[username]/business-website-project.git

Downloaded all website files to EC2 instance

Verified complete file structure in clone directory

Task 3: Deploy Files to Nginx Root
Cleared default Nginx content: sudo rm -rf /var/www/html/*

Moved website files to Nginx root: sudo mv business-website-project/* /var/www/html/

Verified all files in correct location: /var/www/html/

Task 4: Nginx Service Restart
Restarted Nginx: sudo systemctl restart nginx

Confirmed service running with updated content

Day 4: Debugging & Issue Resolution
Common Issues Encountered and Solutions
Issue 1: CSS Files Not Loading

Problem: Styling not appearing on live website

Root Cause: Incorrect file paths in HTML (relative vs absolute paths)

Solution: Updated CSS links to use correct relative paths and verified file permissions

Command Used: sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html to ensure read permissions

Issue 2: Broken Images

Problem: Images showing 404 errors

Root Cause: Image file paths incorrect or files not deployed

Solution: Verified image folder structure and corrected HTML image source paths

Testing: Checked browser console for resource loading errors

Issue 3: Wrong File Paths

Problem: Assets loading from incorrect directories

Root Cause: Different directory structure in GitHub vs deployed location

Solution: Updated all asset paths to match Nginx serving directory structure

Verification: Tested all links and resources individually

Issue 4: 404 Errors

Problem: Pages returning 404 Not Found

Root Cause: File names not matching href links (case sensitivity)

Solution: Ensured consistent file naming and updated all navigation links

Command: ls -la /var/www/html/ to verify file presence

Issue 5: Missing Assets

Problem: JavaScript and CSS files partially deployed

Root Cause: Incomplete git clone or file transfer

Solution: Verified all files copied: sudo ls -R /var/www/html/

Result: Complete file structure confirmed

Issue 6: Permission Issues

Problem: Nginx unable to read certain files

Root Cause: Incorrect file ownership and permissions

Solution:

Applied: sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html

Applied: sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html

Testing: Verified Nginx can read and serve all files
